<!-- About Me -->
## About Me

Hello, I'm Misbahur Rahman, a passionate developer and digital marketer hailing from the beautiful town of Moulvibazar, Bangladesh. When I'm not coding or optimizing digital strategies, I enjoy watching sci-fi movies, traveling, learning new things through online tutorials, and indulging in sports.

<!-- Professional Journey -->
## Professional Journey

I embarked on my journey into the digital world right after my higher-secondary education. My hunger for knowledge led me to explore digital marketing and web development. Eager to expand my skill set, I enrolled in a government course to learn digital marketing. After completing the course in 2017, I ventured into the world of freelance digital marketing on Fiverr.

Simultaneously, I began my diploma in web development at "Shahjalal University of Science and Technology" in late 2017. This marked the beginning of my transition into web development. Over the years, I honed my skills in both fields, eventually focusing on web development, especially in React.js, Next.js, and MERN stack projects.

## Professional Accomplishments

In my digital marketing career, I've had the privilege of working with over 300 YouTubers, assisting them in growing their channels. I've also collaborated with more than 20 business owners, helping them enhance their website's SEO and marketing strategies.

In the web development domain, I've partnered with various companies, including those in the cargo, music, and e-commerce industries. I love working with code, and for me, it's like playing a game. My goal is to become the best developer in my country in the next few years.
