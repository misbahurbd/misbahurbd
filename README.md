Hello, I'm Misbahur Rahman, a passionate developer and digital marketer from Moulvibazar, Bangladesh. I find joy in coding, exploring new technologies, and helping businesses grow.

When I'm not working, I enjoy watching sci-fi movies, traveling to new places, and staying active through sports.

## 🌟 Professional Journey

I kickstarted my digital journey right after completing high school. Eager to learn, I dived into digital marketing and web development. In 2017, I joined a government course to refine my digital marketing skills, and soon after, I began freelancing on Fiverr.

In 2018, I joined the "Shahjalal University of Science and Technology" to pursue a diploma in Web Development. As the years passed, I transitioned into full-time web development, specializing in React.js, Next.js, and the MERN stack.
